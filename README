We start with trainRaw.csv and testRaw.csv, we run 
python transform.py
To generate labeledTestSet.csv unlabeledTestSet.csv partialTrainingSet.csv completeDataSet.csv

After generating the client_secrets.json and placing it in the directory, we run the following line to call on the Prediction API
python gpredictions.py whateveryourbucketis/trainingsetname.csv modelname projectid
which writes to results.csv and is written in such as way as to record even when quota is met during runtime

And after results are recorded, we run
python resultsPNG.py
to get the error graph
